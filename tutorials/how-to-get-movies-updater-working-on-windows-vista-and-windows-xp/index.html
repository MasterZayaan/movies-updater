  <body>
    <p>So, you want to install Movies Updater on Windows Vista or Windows XP.</p>
    <p>Well, while we don't recommend it, you can install the app on Vista or XP but you'll need to do a lot more then just run an installer.</p>
    <p><strong>Installing Movies Updater on Windows Vista:</strong></p>
    <p>First up, you want to download the app and copy then copy the app to wherever you want then run it.</p>
    <p>Once you have run the app, install it!</p>
    <p>Now, what you will need to do is open Command Prompt and then cd to C:\Program Files (x86)\Movies Updater or C:\Program Files\Movies Updater and then type in Starter or Starter.bat.</p>
    <p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>
    <p>Windows Vista doesn't think that the app is a valid Win32 app due to it meant to run on newer OSs.</p>
    <p><strong>Installing Movies Updater on Windows XP:</strong></p>
    <p>Yet again, download the app and copy it to your desktop for easy access.</p>
    <p>This time, you'll need to download 7-Zip and install it.</p>
    <p>Once you have downloaded and installed 7-Zip, right-click on the installer and click Open Archive.</p>
    <p>Then select all the files and folders in the list and press Extract.</p>
    <p>Now if you have a x86/32 bit system, change the extracting path to C:\Program Files\Movies Updater.</p>
    <p>But if you have a x64/64 bit system, change the extracting path to C:\Program Files (x86)\Movies Updater.</p>
    <p><strong>DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE, OTHERWISE MOVIES UPDATER WON'T INSTALL PROPERLY!</strong></p>
    <p>Once extracted do the same process that we did for Vista, open Command Prompt, go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Movies Updater for x64/64 bit systems or go to C:\Program Files\Movies Updater for x86/32 bit systems.</p>
    <p>Finally, once you have gone through all those steps, type in Starter or Starter.bat and enjoy Movies Updater.</p>
    <p>I have also provided all the tools you need to do this, as well as a batch script to put on your desktop so that you can open Movies Updater with ease.</p>
    <p><strong>Issues:</strong></p>
    <p>XP has the same issue with Vista as the EXE is not a valid Win32 app due to it being designed for newer operating systems.</p>
    <p>But XP can't launch the Movies Updater installer for some weird reason.</p>

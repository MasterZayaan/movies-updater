  <body>
    <p>So, you want to install Movies Updater on Windows Vista or Windows XP.</p>

    <p>Well, while we don't recommend it, you can install the app on Vista or XP but you'll need to do a lot more then just run an installer.</p>

    <p><strong>Windows Vista:</strong></p>
    <p>First up, you want to download the ZIP file and copy the latest version to wherever you want then run it.</p>
    <p>Once you have run the app, install it!</p>
    <p>Now, what you will need to do is open Command Prompt and then cd to C:\Program Files (x86)\Movies Updater or C:\Program Files\Movies Updater and then type in Starter or Starter.bat.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
    <p>Windows Vista doesn't think that the app is a valid Win32 app due to it meant to run on newer OSs.</p>
